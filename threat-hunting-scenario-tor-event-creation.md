# Threat Event (Unauthorized TOR Usage)
**Unauthorized TOR Browser Installation and Use**

## Steps the "Bad Actor" took Create Logs and IoCs:
1. The virtual machine was onboarded to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE).
2. Telemetry ingestion was validated using Advanced Hunting queries to confirm that the endpoint was actively reporting data.

* VM onboarded to MDE
* Telemetry confirmed via `DeviceInfo`

## Threat Simulation – Bad Actor Activity

The following actions were intentionally performed to generate TOR-related logs and indicators of compromise (IoCs):

### 1️⃣ TOR Browser Download

The TOR Browser portable installer was downloaded from the official TOR Project website:

🔗 [https://www.torproject.org/download/](https://www.torproject.org/download/)

---

### 2️⃣ Silent Installation of TOR Browser

The TOR Browser portable installer was executed using a silent installation switch to simulate covert software deployment:

```cmd
tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-15.0.3.exe /S
```

</p>

---

### 3️⃣ TOR Browser Execution

The TOR Browser was launched directly from the extracted folder on the desktop.

</p>

* TOR Browser launch
* TOR connection screen

---

### 4️⃣ TOR Network Activity

Once connected to the TOR network, browsing activity was performed to generate anonymized network traffic. Example sites visited include:

* [https://duckduckgo.com](https://duckduckgo.com)
* [https://wikipedia.org](https://wikipedia.org)
* [https://check.torproject.org](https://check.torproject.org)

  <img src="screenshots/Screenshot 2026-01-09 065311.png" width="750">   
</p>

* TOR browser browsing activity
* TOR connectivity confirmation

---

### 5️⃣ User Artifact Creation

A text file named `tor-shopping-list.txt` was created on the desktop containing fictitious illicit items to simulate user note-taking activity associated with TOR usage.

### 6️⃣ Artifact Cleanup

The `tor-shopping-list.txt` file was deleted to generate additional file system activity related to cleanup behavior.

**Purpose:**
Used to detect TOR installer downloads, TOR Browser file extraction, and creation or deletion of the `tor-shopping-list.txt` file.

---

### DeviceProcessEvents

[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-deviceprocessevents-table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-deviceprocessevents-table)

**Purpose:**
Used to detect silent installation of TOR Browser as well as execution of TOR-related processes (`tor.exe`, `firefox.exe`).
